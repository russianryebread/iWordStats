iWordStats
==========

iWordStats is a small test project that I wrote to learn a
little bit about programming in Objective C, and as a small
benchmark utility for my personal iOS devices.

*For Example:*

|     Device     | Speed |
|----------------|:-----:|
| iPhone 3GS     |  9.8  |
| iPod (4th Gen) |  5.5  |
| iPad (2nd Gen) |  2.2  |
| iPhone 5s      |  0.5  |

iWordStats
==========

iWordStats is a small test project that I wrote to learn a
little bit about programming in Objective C, and as a small
benchmark utility for my personal iOS devices.


**For Example:**

|     Device     |   Speed   |
|----------------|:---------:|
| iPhone 3GS     |  9.8 sec. |
| iPod (4th Gen) |  5.5 sec. |
| iPad (2nd Gen) |  2.2 sec. |
| iPhone 5s      |  0.5 sec. |
| iPhone 7       |  0.32 sec |



The wordlist is the old *nix standard one, that can be found in `/usr/share/dict/words`
